===Contents===
Problem identification and formulation: 1
- Practical problem + context: 0
• No problem is identified in the introduction

- Description of state-of-art (summary): 2
• Relevant references are cited to cover state of the art but literature is not synthesized.
Evaluation: 1
- Knowledge gap: 1
• Knowledge gap is not identified explicitly.

- Aims/objectives: 1
• Why framework?
• First three objectives can be grouped to form a single objective.
• SLR not acceptable for A3

- RQs: 2
• Since RQ 1 and 2 are planned to be addressed via SLR, which is not acceptable. You effectively have one question i.e. RQ 3.
Method selection and application: 2
- Research methodology: 2
• You have provided some details about your RM, which is good.
• Why open ended questions?
- Sampling and data collection: 1
• Sampling method or details not described, just a vague sentence at the end of RM section provided.
• Questionnaire is the data collection tool but its use is not justified.

- Data analysis to answer the RQ: 3
• GT is selected as the analysis method and a reference is also provided to justify the choice.
Planning: 2
- reasonable for a 1-month work of 2 people: 1
• Literature review part not reviewed.

- Risks known and under control: 2
• For each risk, four things needs to be specified i.e. likelihood, avoidance, impact and mitigation.
• Risks related to SLR not reviewed
===Presentation===
Disposition: 4
- TOC is according to template: 4
- Expected contents are at the right place: 4
Adherence to formal rules and templates: 4
- template is used (formal part): 3
• Classification of title not appropriate.

- 4-5 page length: 4
Description of work: 2
- Tasks: e.g. work-breakdown structure or Gantt chart: 2
• Literature review part not reviewed.
• Only three days for validating and finalizing the project report?

- Optional: division of work between group members
• Work division amongst group members not discussed
Analysis and **argumentation**: 2
- Credibility of research gap: 1
• Research gap is not appropriately presented and justified.

- Credibility and justification of good research method selection: 1
• Data analysis method is justified.
• RM (i.e. survey) is still not justified properly.
• Sampling and data collection methods are also not justified.

- Credibility of the plan + risk management: 2
• Both risk and time plan needs revisions.
Language: 2
- English grammar and spelling: 2
• Needs to be improved
- Style: 2
• Use numbers instead of bullets e.g. time plan, objectives and risks.
- Presentation and use of the references: 3
• Completely describe references e.g. place for conference reference.

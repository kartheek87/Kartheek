Overall grade===
- Summation of The Points: 2+1+4+2+4+3+2+3+3=24/36= 67% (Grade D)
- Key Feedback Points
Research method is justified with reference, that is good
Research gap needs to be properly identified and presented
Plan should include experiment related tasks as well
Why AKS and Miller Rabin Algorithms ?
===Contents===
Problem identification and formulation: 2
- Practical problem + context: 2
Why algorithms, such as Miller-Rabin, that produce probabilistic results is a problem? Or what problems will deterministic algorithm solve?

- Description of state-of-art (summary): 2
Are there any studies on Miller-Robin Algorithm? With which you want to compare your results
Literature synthesis missing
Evaluation: 1
- Knowledge gap: 2
Gap that you have identified on page 2: “…none of the papers that state such opinions actually invalidate the applicability of AKS algorithm for practical purposes”. It does not go well with the previous sentence.

- Aims/objectives: 1
Why comparing with Miller-Rabin?
Why AKS as you mentioned in introduction that studies say that AKS is not feasible to apply on large numbers?
RM not mentioned along with the aims and objective.
Objective b appears redundant with a

- RQs: 1
RQ1 is not aligned with objectives
Method selection and application: 4
- Research methodology: 4
RM is experiments and is justified as well
- Sampling and data collection: 4
Details about input sizes, input and sampling given.

- Data analysis to answer the RQ: 4
Planning: 2
- reasonable for a 1-month work of 2 people: 2
Proposed time and activity plan does not include activities related to experiment?

- Risks known and under control: 2
For each risk, four things needs to be specified i.e. likelihood, avoidance, impact and mitigation. For example what is your mitigation for risk 2?
Risk mitigation should describe how would you mitigate the risk rather than just saying we will try to deal with the risk.
===Presentation===
Disposition: 4
- TOC is according to template: 4
- Expected contents are at the right place: 4
Adherence to formal rules and templates: 3
- template is used (formal part): 2
It is not a degree project
Write version number for your proposal e.g. 1

- 4-5 page length: 4
Description of work: 2
- Tasks: e.g. work-breakdown structure or Gantt chart: 2
Experiment design and conduct tasks?

- Optional: division of work between group members
Work division amongst group members not discussed
Analysis and **argumentation**: 3
- Credibility of research gap: 2
Identified gap needs to be properly justified

- Credibility and justification of good research method selection: 4

- Credibility of the plan + risk management: 2
Time/activity plan needs to include experiment in it
For risk management, how about time constraints or other external risk factors other than validity threats?
Language: 3
- English grammar and spelling: 4
- Style: 4
- Presentation and use of the references: 1
What is reference 5? Book?
Reference 2 needs some edition.
Reference for Miller-Rabin Algorithm?

gathering information: Participant Observation, 
Non-participant Observation, Field Notes, Reflexive Journals,
 Structured Interview, Semi-structured Interview, Unstructured Interview, and Analysis of documents and materials.

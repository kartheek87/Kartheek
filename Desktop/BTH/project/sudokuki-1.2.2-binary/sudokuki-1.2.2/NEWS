-- Changelog --

The changelog has moved to the 'README' file.


-- Note about "ALPHA", "BETA", "RC", "STABLE" --

"ALPHA" versions

Versions with the ALPHA (Experimental) status are intended to 
provide a preview of a limited set of features that are foreseen
for a future STABLE version. ALPHA versions are also used to
experiment. When you use an ALPHA version, expect bugs and broken
features. 


"BETA" versions

Versions with the BETA status exist when the application is 
almost ready for a STABLE release but needs some more development,
for example to add features, fix bugs, clean-up the code, etc.


"RELEASE CANDIDATE" ("RC") versions

RELEASE CANDIDATE versions exist when the application is ready but
needs final testing and validation before the STABLE release.


"STABLE" versions

STABLE version means a version you can rely on for real use. It
should include all major features that were planned, and should work
as expected.
